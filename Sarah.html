        I am from Comox and I am in the Advanced Communication and Interactive Design program. 
        Before North Island College, I was working as a daily newspaper reporter and studied my 
        Bachelor in Journalism. In my program, I enjoyed the challenge of being creative every day. 
        I had never been so stimulated before. And this goes for design and coding classes. The biggest 
        thing I have learned from the program is to never give up. There is an answer and a solution to 
        every problem. You just have to find it. After graduation I plan to work in Web Development 
        where I can use my design and coding skills. My favourite courses were Computer Graphics and 
        Fine Art Drawing because that's how I discovered that I was an artist. I enjoyed HTML &amp; CSS 
        and JavaScript because that's how I discovered that I'm also a coder. I also enjoyed Typography 
        because I'm a nerd and love type. I like cats and board games. Both challenge me and that's how 
        I get my kicks.

        <div>
           The project I am displaying in the showcase is a redesigned set of four garden seed packages 
           that I created for a class project. My packaging is unique because instead of putting plants 
           on the front of my seed packages I put images of tasty dishes you can cook after growing the 
           vegetables from my seeds. I invented a company called Nosh Seed Co. and our tagline is: for 
           gardeners who love to eat. In that vein, I redesigned a cookbook to go with the seed packages. 
           Finally, I developed an e-commerce website so that I can sell my seeds online.
