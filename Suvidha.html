      <p class="avenir write-up-size para-size margin-for-write-up">My name is Suvidha Khanna Chanana. 
        I am from Shimla, India and I am in the Communication Design program. Before North Island College, 
        I was working as a trainee at an ad agency and studied my Graduation Degree in Applied Arts. 
        In my program, I enjoyed the whole process of learning, making friends and spending most of my 
        time in Mac Lab (it became my first home). The faculty has been very supportive and soon, 
        we all together - the students and profs - were like a gang. I very much have embraced and learned 
        more and developed as a designer in this course of time. The biggest thing I have learned from the 
        program is design skills, understanding of type, use of the Adobe Suite, printing techniques and a 
        better understanding of camera and photography. After graduation I plan to work as a designer and 
        impact society with my designs and ideas. </br>
        My favourite courses were Typography, Graphic Design, Photography, Video & Sound and Printmaking. 
        A lot of credit goes to the professors teaching these courses, as they made me fall in love with 
        the them along with great learning. Typography meant nothing but the alphabet to me before this 
        course and now it's one of the assets I have added to my little bag of knowledge. Designing was 
        my passion, but now I feel more confident and polished. Photography, Video, Sound (foley) and 
        Printmaking were new to me and now I can say I am getting better at them and would love to 
        explore them more in depth. </br>
        I am an ambitious designer who wants to impact the society with my design ideas. The course 
        introduced me to the exquisite art of typography and soon enough it became a part of my design 
        philosophy. I had some exposure of the advertising world and there I saw the power design had 
        at influencing and creating an impact on the society and people. This is my dream and the very 
        part of my being now. I wish to design, to bring a difference.

        <div>
            The project I am displaying in the showcase is Hot Chocolates. 
            Hot Chocolates is an Island based artisan chocolate brand. Their 
            current branding does not invite people of all ages in. To make 
            the brand appeal to a larger target audience, Hot Chocolates 
            needed a brand makeover. Along with the refurbishing their logo, 
            we would also create new and more innovative packaging for their 
            truffles. These packages will not only make them stand apart from 
            their competitors but also encourage more interactivity with the brand.
