      <p class="avenir write-up-size para-size margin-for-write-up">My name is David Carmichael. 
        I am from Campbell River and I am in the Web and Mobile App Development program. 
        Before North Island College, I was in the Canadian Forces as an Army Communication and 
        Information Systems Specialist (ACISS) for 9 and a half years. In my program, I enjoyed 
        learning new technologies and meeting new people. The biggest thing I have learned from 
        the program is how much versatile a developer needs to be. After graduation I plan to 
        find work and possibly start my own business. My favourite course was Portfolio Project 
        because I have been using everything that I have learned and more. After spending 9 1/2 
        years in the Canadian Forces (almost my entire adulthood) upon my release I decided I 
        wanted a new career that offers me more freedom in my life, and challenge me more intellectually. 
        I grew up a huge music fan, and despite not being musically talented, itâ€™s always had major 
        influence in my life. One of my goals is to use the skills and knowledge I have acquired through 
        my military service, and the NIC web and mobile app program to further evolved, improve and 
        make a positive impact on the music industry as we move forward into the future. 
        I also have a dog, a border collie named Sadie whom is awesome.

            The project I am displaying in the showcase is my District Decibel concept, 
            which is a music streaming website that also offers many other services 
            and features that currently fans and musicians must go to several platforms 
            to have access to. Having all these services all in one location and made 
            in a clean and user friendly format will provide the best experience for 
            fans and an all inclusive tool for musicians to promote their art. The project 
            will be built with Wordpress (PHP, HTML, CSS), with an embedded app created with 
            Javascript with the Vue.JS framework.
