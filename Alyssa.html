      <p class="avenir write-up-size para-size margin-for-write-up">My name is Alyssa Willis. 
        I am from Campbell River and I am in the Communication Design program. Before North 
        Island College, I was a certified Nail Technician after studying at Del Rio Academy. 
        In my program, I enjoyed learning all the facets of design, from the principles of 
        design to colour, typography and grids. I appreciated the push that the critiques 
        gave me to explore new ideas and try new things. The biggest thing I have learned 
        from the program is to be confident in my design choices and how to look at things 
        differently. After graduation I plan to work in the print and web design field. I 
        will also continue creating art strictly for the passion of creating. My favourite 
        courses were Computer Graphics 1 & 2, Communication Design 2, UI & UX Design, HTML & 
        CSS and Drawing & 2D Language. because I feel as though I found my feet and learned 
        many new skills in these courses. They gave me a new sense of confidence in my ability. 
        One thing about my personality is that I am a people-person who is very dedicated and 
        hardworking, and almost always has a smile on my face.

        <div>
            The project I am displaying in the showcase is a rebranding project 
            that was done in the Communication Design 2 course. We were asked to 
            choose a local business and give them a fresh new look from logo and 
            stationery to packaging and collateral branding. I chose a local 
            business called True Blue Pet Supplies because I care very much about 
            animals and I admire that they carry organic, all natural pet supplies.
